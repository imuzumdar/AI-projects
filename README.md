# AI-projects
This repo features some implementations of popular AI frameworks and algorithms I developed during college. Below are a list
of the projects I worked on:

1. BFS and DFS applied to a variety of games
2. IDDFS, A*, and minimax search (with alpha-beta pruning) applied to a variety of games
3. Naive-Bayes Spam Classifier 
4. Markov Model for Text Generation
5. Hidden Markov Model for part-of-speech tagging in parse trees (includes dynamically programmed algorithm for faster prediction)
6. Sudoku AI that uses heuristic inference, back-tracing, and AC-3 constraint satisfaction to solve puzzles
